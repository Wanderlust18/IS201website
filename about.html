                                <p>My father has always loved going off the beaten path. As a result, instead of going to touristy places like most people do, we have gone on many irregular adventures in different countries. When I was 9, we lived in Costa Rica for a month. When I was 12, we flew to Cambodia for 2 weeks and explored several parts of the country. In that same year, my family roadtripped up to Canada and explored Banff National Park. This isn't even mentioning all the in-state traveling we did. </p>

                                   In 2020, after many years of my parents sacrificing and working hard, they bought a 48ft Leopard Catamaran sailboat. We left the United States from Florida, and continued to sail down the island chain to Grenada, stopping at places like the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, then headed West through the ABC Islands and Colombia, then back North East up through Central America to places like Honduras and Guatemala. Here, we sailed across the Gulf of Mexico and arrived to the Dry Tortugas off the coast of Florida. The whole experience took about two years, and through it all I fell in love with travelling. I learned how to free dive, and how to sail. I swam with sharks and turtles and stingrays. I've held parrots, and sloths, and monkeys. I met some of the most incredble people and are still great friends with them today. I learned more about history, culture, and God. I learned more about myself and who I am, and what I value in life.
