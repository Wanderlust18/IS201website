<br>
    <p class="opening" >I have always taken pride in working as a swim instructor, lifeguard and captain over the past three years. Striving to do my best and learn as much as I can is important to me. I can work well in a variety of environments, including harsh ones. I know how to enforce policies with kindness while still being firm, administer first aid and CPR, and communicate with those around me effectively.</p>
